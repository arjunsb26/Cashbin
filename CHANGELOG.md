## 2026-09-19, step 0: skeleton and contracts

Milestone M0, plus every cross-lane contract frozen so the lanes can run in parallel.

### Backend

- `backend/pyproject.toml` on Python 3.12, managed by `uv`. FastAPI, pydantic v2,
  pydantic-settings, SQLAlchemy 2, hypercorn, numpy, opencv-python-headless, websockets,
  cryptography. Dev group has pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx, trio, ruff, mypy. `uv run pytest`
  runs everything, including the contract and generated-types checks.
- `app/config.py` holds every tunable from PLAN.md section 18 as a pydantic-settings model.
  Environment overrides it, and the uppercase names PLAN.md uses set the fields directly.
  Adds `DEV_TOOLS`, `HTTPS_PORT`, `HTTP_PORT`, `CERT_DIR`, and the three product name fields
  read from `brand.json`. Every string setting has its trailing carriage return stripped.
- `app/db.py` builds the SQLite engine in WAL mode with foreign keys on, creates every table
  at startup, and hands out sessions.
- `app/models.py` has all thirteen tables from PLAN.md section 8 with the exact column names,
  including `class` where the plan uses it. Money is integer cents, mass is float grams,
  timestamps are UTC ISO strings. The chart of accounts is a constant. `identification` also
  carries `provider` and `model`, because CLAUDE.md requires every identification row to say
  what served it.
- `app/schemas.py` is the contract. Every socket message from PLAN.md section 6 as
  discriminated unions on `type`, every REST body from section 14, the strict `VisionResult`
  and `ValueEstimate` from section 9, and `ValidatedLabel` for outside text.
- `app/notify/lcd.py` builds every LCD screen. `app/notify/bus.py` is the in-process pub/sub
  that fans out to `/ws/ui` and `/ws/phone`.
- `app/identify/providers.py` and `app/identify/embed.py` hold only the Protocols and
  `IdentifyContext`. Lane C writes the implementations.
- `app/api/*.py` has a route for every path in PLAN.md section 14. Each returns 501 with a
  plain body and a header naming the lane that fills it. `/api/sim/*` and the API docs only
  mount when `DEV_TOOLS` is on.
- `app/main.py` is the app factory. Health at `GET /api/health`, `GET /brand.json` with no
  caching, static mounts for `/media` and `/phone`, and the three sockets accepting a
  connection, checking the hello, and answering ping and pong.

### Contracts

- `firmware_contract.md` at the root carries PLAN.md section 6 verbatim for the hardware
  teammate. `backend/tests/test_contract.py` validates every JSON line in it against the
  models, so the document cannot drift.
- `scripts/gen_types.py` writes `contracts/api-schema.json` and `contracts/api-types.ts`.
  `scripts/check_types.py` fails when either is stale, and the test suite calls it.

### Scripts

- `scripts/make_cert.py` writes a self-signed certificate covering `localhost` and every LAN
  address this machine has, so the phone can reach it by IP. Neither file is printed.
- `scripts/run_backend.py` serves HTTPS on `:8443` and HTTP on `:8000` from one hypercorn
  process. Both binds verified by request.

### Tests

202 tests. Health and the database, every wire example round-tripping, LCD truncation, bus
fan-out, the three sockets, the firmware contract, the generated types, and the twenty-five
input attack set in `backend/tests/attack_set.py` run against all three places outside text
reaches the system.

### Decisions worth knowing

- LCD line and big fields truncate instead of refusing. PLAN.md section 6 states a hard width
  and also says the backend is responsible for truncation, and its own example second line is
  21 characters. Truncating in the type makes both statements true and means nothing wider
  than the screen can ever reach the bin.
- `memory_max_dist` has no default in PLAN.md. It starts at 0.35 and is a live setting.
